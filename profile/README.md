### Branch policies

We use gitflow workflow for managing git branches. If you're not familliar with gitflow please follow [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) tutorial. Additionally, all PRs are checked by a linting workflow using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
